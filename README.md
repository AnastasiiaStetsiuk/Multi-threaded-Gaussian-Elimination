# Multi-threaded-Gaussian-Elimination
This project demonstrates a multi-threaded application of the Gaussian elimination algorithm using the "Peer-to-Peer" model and synchronization techniques with Win32 API in C++. The program performs Gaussian elimination on a matrix using multiple threads to parallelize the computation.
